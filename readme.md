# Artifitial neural network for the breast cancer dataset

We try to create a demo of a neural network based on the given data for the breast cancer data. Upon processing the data to the requirement and loading it on the google colab. We use the TensorFlow Keras library to answer our problem, we were able to demonstrate a neural network for the given problem but as per expectations, we were able to reach an accuracy of above 90%.

**The dataset used in this project was** [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set](<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(original)>)
